:wave: Hello! Welcome to my github profile, here you will see all of my various antics as I keep attempting to code on my day to day basis. I originally started off coding by making scripts to automatically collect resources in games but now it has become an addition or is it a hobby?

These days I am up to coding anything from websites to python libraries and besides programming I am into :video_game: gaming and :book: reading. If you have a project or are in need of a collaborator let me know as I'm always willing to help and learn at the same time.
